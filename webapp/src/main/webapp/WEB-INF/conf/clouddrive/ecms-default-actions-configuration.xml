    Default ECMS menu actions for Cloud Drive. You can add or replace defaults with your set of menus.
    Search in Cloud Drive connectors' configuration for action names to add or remove.
    Sample: if need remove "Connect Cloud Documents" which is ShowConnectCloudDrive action and 
    add "Connect your Google Drive" which is an action configured in Google Drive as ConnectGDrive. 
    Then remove ShowConnectCloudDrive value below and add respectively ConnectGDrive. After that 
    when CloudDriveUIService will start (e.g. on the server start), it will add "Connect your Google Drive"
    to the ECMS views.
